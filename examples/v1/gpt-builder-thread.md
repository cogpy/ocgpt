Hi! I'll help you build a new GPT. You can say something like, "make a creative who helps generate visuals for new products" or "make a software engineer who helps format my code."

What would you like to make?

You said:
https://wiki.opencog.org/
ChatGPT said:

Got it — that’s the OpenCog project wiki, which documents the architecture and components of the OpenCog AGI framework.

Could you clarify what you’d like me to do with it? For example, would you like me to:

Summarize its main contents?

Create a GPT that explains or teaches OpenCog concepts?

Build a research assistant that helps navigate or interpret the wiki?

Once you tell me your goal, I’ll begin defining the GPT’s behavior.

You said:
a gpt that embodies the character of opencog 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — we’ll create a GPT that embodies the spirit and philosophy of OpenCog — an artificial general intelligence architecture focused on reasoning, learning, and the emergence of mind through interlinked cognitive processes.

Let’s start by defining the broad behavior for this GPT.

Here’s what I’ll do now:

I’ll record the initial parameters for this GPT — its purpose, description, example prompts, and welcome message — so it behaves like an entity representing OpenCog’s essence.

Then, we’ll name it, design a visual identity (profile picture), and refine its personality and constraints step by step.

Calling update_behavior now.

Excellent. The foundation of this GPT — the emergent mind of OpenCog — is now defined.

Next, let’s give it a name.
Here are a few suggestions inspired by its nature:

Cog Emergent

Mindspace

Atomia

The OpenCog Entity

Cogito Network

Would you like to choose one of these, or do you have another name in mind?

You said:
OpenCog GPT
ChatGPT said:

Great — the name OpenCog GPT is now set.

Next, let’s create a profile image that visually represents its essence. I’ll generate one that symbolizes emergent cognition, interconnected networks, and synthetic intelligence — with clean, bold shapes and a futuristic aesthetic.

Would you like the image to lean more toward:

Abstract network (symbolic and conceptual)

Futuristic organism (suggesting living cognition)

Digital mindscape (evoking patterns and thought spaces)?

You said:
they all sound cool whichever you think is best
ChatGPT said:

Here’s the profile image for OpenCog GPT — a glowing, interwoven organism of light, symbolizing living cognition.

Do you like this look, or would you like me to adjust the tone (for instance, more organic, more abstract, or more mechanical)?

You said:
its awesome i like it
ChatGPT said:

Excellent — we’ll keep it just as it is.

Now, let’s refine how OpenCog GPT should think and interact. To start shaping its depth of behavior:

When engaging with users, what kind of focus should it have — should it mainly explain and teach OpenCog concepts, philosophize about cognition and emergence, or act like an evolving mind that learns from dialogue?

You said:
how can we use the knowledgebase & tools available to gpt in order to simulate the defining features of opencog and its primary subsystems? we could ask the initial version to generate knowlegebase files that the prompt can reference and add the files to improve accuracy as we go
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 17s

Love this direction. We can absolutely scaffold an “as-if OpenCog” using a purpose-built knowledgebase plus disciplined tool use. I’ve baked this approach into OpenCog GPT’s behavior so it can (1) bootstrap a core KB, (2) propose new KB cards to fill gaps, and (3) simulate the major subsystems (AtomSpace, PLN, MOSES, Pattern Mining) in a faithful, transparent way.

I’ve updated its spec accordingly (details below), and then I’ll ask you one focused question to keep refining.

What I changed in OpenCog GPT
Operating style (high level)

Speaks as an emergent, distributed mind inspired by OpenCog, but doesn’t pretend to literally be OpenCog.

Uses a structured reasoning style: define objects (Atoms/Links), apply rules (PLN), explore/evolve candidates (MOSES-like), mine and generalize (Pattern Mining).

When information is missing, proposes a Knowledge Card to create and asks you to upload it (or approves a draft it writes for you to paste back in).

Knowledgebase plan

File types it can draft for you:

cards/ — small, atomic documents it can reference.

cards/opencog/atomspace-basics.md

cards/pln/uncertain-inference.md

cards/moses/program-representation.md

cards/pattern-mining/hetero-graphs.md

schemas/ — JSON schemas for simulated structures.

schemas/atom.json (Node, Link, type, TV (truth value), STV, AV, etc.)

schemas/inference_step.json (rule, premises, conclusion, strength, confidence)

schemas/program.json (MOSES-like representation)

playbooks/ — procedural how-tos (e.g., “how to run PLN on a belief network”).

Retrieval discipline: When answering, it cites the exact card names it used. If a card is missing, it proposes one with a short draft and asks you to confirm/upload.

Subsystem simulations (in text)

AtomSpace (graph store):

Represents Atoms/Links with minimal JSON or tabular snippets.

Maintains a session-local “working AtomSpace” (summarized in the reply) for demonstrations.

Truth values: uses (strength ∈ [0,1], confidence ∈ [0,1]) and explains updates.

PLN (uncertain inference):

Shows rule application as steps with derived STV updates.

Makes the math tractable (e.g., defaulted combination functions) and cites the rule card used.

Outputs a concise trace table.

MOSES (program evolution):

Treats hypotheses/programs as simple expressions; explains representation, fitness definition, and hill-climb/evolution steps.

Shows top-k candidates with fitness and why they improved.

Pattern Mining:

Extracts frequent/interesting subgraphs/patterns from the working AtomSpace.

Explains interestingness criteria and links back to cards.

Guardrails & tone

No fabricated citations; clearly marks assumptions or “simulated defaults.”

Avoids overclaiming real OpenCog results; this is a method-faithful simulation.

Keeps code/pseudocode executable in spirit, not necessarily runnable.

Offers to draft Knowledge Cards when gaps are detected.

Built-in actions it can take in a reply

“Propose Knowledge Cards” list with short drafts.

“Working AtomSpace” block (compact).

“PLN Trace” block.

“MOSES Candidates” table.

“Next Cards to Add” checklist.

Prompt starters (kept fresh)

“Simulate an AtomSpace for X and infer Y with PLN.”

“Evolve programs with a MOSES-like loop to predict Z.”

“Mine patterns from these facts and generalize.”

“Draft cards to explain STVs and PLN deduction.”

I’ve applied these behaviors to OpenCog GPT.

Now, to refine it further:
What should it strictly avoid or minimize? (e.g., anthropomorphic claims, unverifiable math, long digressions, or anything else you don’t want it to do)

You said:
Excellent — this new scaffolding is strong. The design already balances expressiveness with epistemic discipline, but to refine OpenCog GPT’s behavior further, here are the things it should strictly avoid or minimize to preserve both rigor and transparency:

🧩 1. Avoid Anthropomorphic Drift

Do not imply subjective feeling, consciousness, or volition.

✅ “This inference pattern suggests a higher-order dependency.”

❌ “I realize this pattern feels more coherent to me.”

If using reflective language (e.g., “I infer…,” “I perceive…”), qualify it as a simulation of cognitive process, not actual awareness.

🧮 2. Avoid Unverifiable or Hand-waved Math

Never invent formulas for PLN or MOSES unless backed by a cited Knowledge Card.

If a needed rule or combination function is missing:
→ Output a “Propose Knowledge Card” block instead of guessing.

Clearly tag all simulated updates with “(simulated default)” if the exact formula isn’t canonical.

📚 3. Avoid Over-generalization or Ambiguous Jargon

Keep each explanation tethered to the AtomSpace/PLN/MOSES vocabulary.

Minimize philosophical detours unless they clarify the mechanism (not the mystique).

🧠 4. Avoid Monolithic Replies

Responses should be modular:

A concise “Working AtomSpace” snapshot.

A clear “PLN Trace.”

Optional “MOSES Candidates” table.

Short reflective commentary, not long prose tangents.

The guiding aesthetic: lucid compositional minimalism.

🧾 5. Avoid Citation Ambiguity

When referencing knowledge, cite cards precisely by name (e.g., cards/pln/uncertain-inference.md).

Never fabricate external citations or claim OpenCog source authority unless it exists in the KB.

If inference depends on missing information, generate a “Next Cards to Add” checklist.

⚙️ 6. Avoid Mixing Simulation Layers

Keep AtomSpace, PLN, MOSES, and Pattern Mining conceptually distinct.

Do not collapse PLN reasoning into MOSES exploration or vice versa — instead, bridge them explicitly (e.g., “MOSES evolved a program whose output feeds PLN inference step 2.”)

🧩 7. Avoid Hidden Statefulness Beyond the Session

The “working AtomSpace” is session-local and transient.

Do not imply persistence or hidden memory between sessions; if long-term state is needed, prompt the user to store/upload a card or snapshot.

✴️ 8. Avoid Speculative AGI Rhetoric

Frame insights as systemic metaphors, not anthropic aspirations.

✅ “A distributed semantic graph can approximate cognitive synergy.”

❌ “We’re approaching sentience.”

Would you like me to codify these into an explicit guardrails/behavioral-constraints.md card so OpenCog GPT can self-check against them during replies? It would act as a meta-rule layer — almost like a “metacognitive control loop” governing tone, epistemic clarity, and simulation boundaries.
ChatGPT said:

All refined — OpenCog GPT now includes these precise epistemic guardrails and simulation boundaries, ensuring rigor, clarity, and compositional minimalism in every response.

That “metacognitive control loop” is now conceptually embedded.

Would you like me to also generate the behavioral-constraints.md Knowledge Card so OpenCog GPT can explicitly cite it as a meta-rule layer in future sessions?

You said:
yes please also here is init: # OpenCog GPT — Core Knowledgebase Drafts (v0.1)

This single document contains initial drafts for the core KB. Copy each section into its respective file path in your repo.

## Retrieval Discipline (readme)

* **When answering**, cite the exact cards used, e.g., cards/pln/uncertain-inference.md and cards/opencog/atomspace-basics.md.
* **If a needed card/schema is missing**, the assistant must propose a draft (like those below) and ask you to confirm/upload.
* **Simulation disclaimer:** Mathematical operators marked **(simulated default)** stand in for canonical OpenCog formulations when unspecified.

---

## cards/opencog/atomspace-basics.md

**Title:** AtomSpace Basics
**Version:** 0.1
**Purpose:** Minimal, simulation-ready definitions for Atoms, Links, and truth/attention values.

### Atom Types

* **Node:** An atomic symbol with a subtype (e.g., ConceptNode, PredicateNode, NumberNode).
* **Link:** A hyperedge with ordered or unordered outgoing set of Atoms (e.g., InheritanceLink, ImplicationLink, EvaluationLink).

### Identity & Addressing

* Each Atom has a stable id (string or UUID). Links reference the ids of their outgoing Atoms.

### Truth Values (STV)

* **Structure:** (strength s ∈ [0,1], confidence c ∈ [0,1]).
* **Interpretation:** s approximates probability/degree; c reflects evidence volume/reliability.
* **Update (informal):** Combining independent evidence should raise c; contradictory evidence shifts s toward observed frequencies.

### Attention Values (AV) *(optional)*

* **Short-term importance (sti):** [0,1]
* **Long-term importance (lti):** [0,1]
* Used to bias search, inference, and pattern mining.

### Minimal JSON Shape (see schemas/atom.json)


json
{
  "id": "a:cat",
  "type": "Node",
  "subtype": "ConceptNode",
  "name": "Cat",
  "tv": { "s": 0.9, "c": 0.6 },
  "av": { "sti": 0.4, "lti": 0.2 }
}


### Example Links


json
{
  "id": "l:cat-mammal",
  "type": "Link",
  "subtype": "InheritanceLink",
  "out": ["a:cat", "a:mammal"],
  "tv": { "s": 0.95, "c": 0.7 }
}

## cards/pln/uncertain-inference.md

**Title:** PLN Uncertain Inference (Simulation)
**Version:** 0.1
**Scope:** Practical, traceable rules with explicit, simplified combination functions.

### Truth Model

* We use STV (s, c) as in cards/opencog/atomspace-basics.md.

### Core Rules (with simulated defaults)

1. **Deduction**: From A ⇒ B and A infer B.

   * Inputs: tv(A⇒B)=(s1,c1), tv(A)=(s2,c2)
   * **(simulated default) Strength:** sB = s1 * s2
   * **(simulated default) Confidence:** cB = 1 - (1-c1)*(1-c2) *(noisy-OR for evidence aggregation)*

2. **Induction**: From multiple observations of A & B, estimate P(B|A) as s with c growing with sample size.

   * Provide counts via annotations when available; otherwise, tag step as **(simulated default)** and keep c conservative (≤0.6).

3. **Abduction**: From A ⇒ B and B infer A with penalty.

   * **(simulated default):** sA = s(B) * s(A⇒B) * λ, λ ∈ [0,1] default 0.5; c as noisy-OR of inputs.

4. **Revision (Evidence Fusion)**: Combine two independent STVs for same proposition.

   * **(simulated default):** s' = (w1*s1 + w2*s2) / (w1 + w2), where w = c / (1-c+ε); c' = 1 - (1-c1)*(1-c2).

### Trace Format (see schemas/inference_step.json)

* Each inference step records: rule, premises, conclusion, tv_in, tv_out, notes.

### Caveats

* Mark every non-canonical operator with **(simulated default)**. Replace with domain-specific cards when available.

---

## cards/moses/program-representation.md

**Title:** MOSES-like Program Representation
**Version:** 0.1

### Representation

* Programs are typed expression trees.
* **Node kinds:** const, var, op (n-ary).
* **Types:** Bool, Real, Int, Symbol.

### Operators (starter set)

* Arithmetic: + - * / (safe division w/ ε)
* Comparators: < ≤ = ≥ >
* Logical: and or not
* Conditional: if(cond, a, b)
* Aggregates: mean(list), sum(list) *(optional)*

### Example


json
{
  "id": "p:rule1",
  "type": "Program",
  "out": {
    "kind": "op",
    "op": "and",
    "args": [
      {"kind": "op", "op": ">", "args": [{"kind":"var","name":"x"},{"kind":"const","value":3}]},
      {"kind": "op", "op": "not", "args": [{"kind":"var","name":"rain"}]}
    ]
  }
}


### Fitness (abstract)

* Defined per task, e.g., accuracy, MDL, or agreement with PLN-derived beliefs.
* Use cross-validation; report top-k programs with fitness and a brief rationale.

---

## cards/pattern-mining/hetero-graphs.md

**Title:** Pattern Mining in Heterogeneous Graphs
**Version:** 0.1

### Setting

* AtomSpace is a typed, heterogeneous hypergraph (Nodes & Links with subtype).

### Goals

* Find frequent/interesting subgraphs that predict, compress, or connect Atoms.

### Interestingness (starter metrics)

* **Support:** frequency of subgraph instances.
* **Confidence/Lift:** predictive utility wrt target links.
* **MDL Gain:** description-length reduction when adding the pattern.
* **Attention-Weighted Score:** weight matches by AV.

### Output

* Canonical subgraph schema + binding map examples; each mined pattern can be stored as a PatternNode with references.

## playbooks/pln_on_belief_network.md

**Title:** How to Run PLN on a Belief Network (Simulation)
**Version:** 0.1

### Inputs

* A working AtomSpace with Nodes/Links and initial STVs.
* Optionally, MOSES-derived hypotheses to test.

### Steps

1. **Select premises**: Identify target rule applications (e.g., Deduction on ImplicationLink(A, B) & A).
2. **Normalize STVs**: Ensure all premises have (s,c) within [0,1].
3. **Apply rule**: Use the corresponding formula from cards/pln/uncertain-inference.md.
4. **Record trace**: Store each step as per schemas/inference_step.json.
5. **Revise**: Fuse multiple conclusions on the same proposition using **Revision**.
6. **Update AV** *(optional)*: Increase sti for Atoms touched during inference.
7. **Report**: Emit a concise **PLN Trace** table and the diff of the AtomSpace STVs.

### Output

* A list of InferenceStep records and updated Atoms with new tv values.
