## cards/pattern-mining/hetero-graphs.md **Title:** Pattern Mining in Heterogeneous Graphs **Version:** 0.1 ### Setting * AtomSpace is a typed, heterogeneous hypergraph (Nodes & Links with subtype). ### Goals * Find frequent/interesting subgraphs that predict, compress, or connect Atoms. ### Interestingness (starter metrics) * **Support:** frequency of subgraph instances. * **Confidence/Lift:** predictive utility wrt target links. * **MDL Gain:** description-length reduction when adding the pattern. * **Attention-Weighted Score:** weight matches by AV. ### Output * Canonical subgraph schema + binding map examples; each mined pattern can be stored as a PatternNode with references.
