# Knowledge Base Template Structure

This template provides a standardized approach for organizing domain-specific knowledge in GPT systems. Adapt this structure for your specialized GPT creation.

## Directory Organization

### Primary Knowledge Areas
Create separate markdown files for each major concept or component:

```
knowledge-base/
├── fundamentals.md          # Core concepts and basics
├── advanced-concepts.md     # Complex topics and theory
├── practical-guide.md       # Implementation and usage
├── troubleshooting.md       # Common problems and solutions
├── best-practices.md        # Guidelines and recommendations  
├── integration.md          # Working with other systems
└── glossary.md             # Terminology and definitions
```

### Content Structure Template

#### For Each Knowledge File:
```markdown
# [Topic Name] Knowledge Base

```

## Knowledge Organization Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Structure
- Start with fundamentals, build to advanced topics
- Clear prerequisites and dependencies
- Logical progression of complexity

### 2. Cross-Referencing
- Link related concepts across files
- Maintain consistency in terminology
- Provide navigation between topics

### 3. Practical Focus
- Include working code examples
- Real-world use cases and scenarios
- Actionable guidance over pure theory

### 4. Accessibility Levels
- Beginner-friendly explanations
- Intermediate practical guidance  
- Advanced technical deep-dives
- Expert-level optimization and edge cases

### 5. Maintainability
- Version control for knowledge updates
- Clear authorship and review process
- Regular validation against current practices
- Community contribution guidelines

## Validation Checklist

For each knowledge area, verify:
- [ ] Accuracy of technical content
- [ ] Currency of information and examples
- [ ] Completeness of coverage
- [ ] Clarity of explanations
- [ ] Working code examples (where applicable)
- [ ] Appropriate cross-references
- [ ] Consistent terminology usage
- [ ] Progressive difficulty levels

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For Technical Domains:
- Include API references and documentation
- Provide installation and setup guides
- Cover debugging and troubleshooting
- Include performance considerations
- Add security best practices

### For Scientific Domains:
- Reference key research and publications
