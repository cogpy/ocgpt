## Development Notes

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Decided to include all major OpenCog components rather than focusing on one area
2. **Multi-Audience Approach**: Designed to serve researchers, developers, and students with adaptive explanations
3. **Code-Heavy**: Emphasized practical code examples over pure theoretical discussions
4. **Current Information**: Included web browsing to stay updated with latest developments
5. **Interactive Testing**: Code interpreter enables hands-on demonstrations and debugging

### Challenges Addressed:
- Balancing depth vs. breadth of OpenCog knowledge
- Ensuring technical accuracy while maintaining accessibility
- Managing the complexity of cognitive architecture topics
- Providing useful practical guidance beyond documentation
- Staying current with rapidly evolving OpenCog ecosystem

### Future Enhancement Ideas:
- Integration with OpenCog community resources
- Real-time collaboration features for development projects  
- Enhanced visualization capabilities for cognitive architectures
- Specialized sub-domains (e.g., OpenCog for robotics, NLP, etc.)
- Performance benchmarking and optimization tools
