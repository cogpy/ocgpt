# Initial GPT Builder Request

## User Request
Create an OpenCog-GPT that serves as an expert AI system for working with OpenCog cognitive architecture, reasoning systems, and AGI development.

## Builder Response
I'll help you create an OpenCog-GPT! Let me start by asking some clarifying questions:

1. What specific aspects of OpenCog would you like the GPT to focus on? (e.g., AtomSpace, PLN reasoning, pattern mining, language processing)
2. What kind of users will primarily interact with this GPT? (researchers, developers, students)
3. Should it include practical code examples and implementation guidance?
4. Do you want it to help with both theoretical concepts and practical applications?

Based on your responses, I'll configure the GPT with appropriate instructions, capabilities, and knowledge base.
